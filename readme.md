## Idea
The concept is very simple, the program shall click on the cookie for a total of 5 minutes and every 5 seconds, it shall check among the upgrades. 
If an upgrades are available it shall select the upgrade of the highest value (that is available) and proceed further.
Once 5 minutes are up, the program shall print the cookie per minute to the terminal.
